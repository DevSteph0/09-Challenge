## Description:

Very quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the projects and to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. Review the Professional README Guide as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain.
The application will be invoked by using the following command:


## Installation:

first input node index.js into the terminal to start (i forgot to mention in the video)

## Future:

More options in read me generator so user are able to make their audience fully understand their concept of the project their potentially trying to create.
